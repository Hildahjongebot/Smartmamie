CONDUCTING A SECURITY AUDIT.

1 DEFINE SCOPE AND OBJECTIVES.

 SCOPE: The objective of this audit is defined as the entire security program at Botium Toys. This includes their assests like employee equipment and devices, their internal network, and their systems. I will review the assets Botium Toys has and the controls and compliance practices they have in place.

Goals: Assess existing assets and complete the controls and compliance checklist to deterlmine which controls and complaince best practices that need to be implemented to improve Botium Toys'security posture.


 2. CURRENT INVENTORY ASSETS

Assets managed by the IT Department include:
* On-premises equipment for in-office business needs
* Employee equipment: end-user devices (desktops/laptops, smartphones), remote workstations,headsets,cables,keyboards,mice,docking stations,surviellance cameras,ect.
* Storefront products available for retail sale on site and online; stored in company's adjoining warehouse
* Management of systems, software, and services: accounting,telecommunicationns,database, security, ecommerce, and inventory management
* Internet access
* Internal network
* Data retention and storage
* Legaacy system maintenance: end-of-life systems that require human monitoring

Step 3. Risk Assessment
Identifying Threats and Vulnerabilities
Risk assessment, is a process that identifies potential hazards and analyzes the likelihood and consequences of those hazards occurring.The goal of a risk assessment is to help reduce the potential impact of hazards on an organization.

* Currently, there is inadequate management of assets.

* Botium Toys does not have all of the proper controls in place and may not be fully complaint with United State and international regulations and standards. Employeee training programs, access control mechanisms, and automated systems that flag potential compliance breaches.

* Identifying that currently all Botium Toys employees have access to internally store data and may be able to access cardholder data and customers'PII/SPII. We will help Botium identifying a user based on their credentials and then authorizing the appropriate lebel of access once they are authenticated. Example passwords, pins, security tokens, and biometric scans are all credentials to put in place for users.
-We will need phishing protection 
-Ransoware protection
-Advance email protection

* Encryption is not currently used to ensure confidentiality of customers' credit card information that is accepted,processed,transmittedd, and stored locally in the company's internal database. VeraCrypt is a free and open source utility and can be run on multiple operating systems. It conceals encrypted data twice, hiding encrypted datasets.

* Acess controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented. We could use Electronic accesssystems.These systems will regulate physical access to a premises, usually with a plastic card or a fob in restricted area.

* Protect. The IT department has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
- The IT department has a firewall (is a network security device that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic to prevent unauthorized access to a computer network).
  
* Detect. Antivirus software is installed and monitored regularly by the IT department.
 - The IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS). The cybersecurity IDS which is network securit application that monitors network traffic and system activity for signs of malicious or unauthorize activity. two types NIDS and HIDS.
   
- There are no disaster recovery plans currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data. We will have (DRP) Is a strategy and process that helpls Botium Toys respond to a cyber attack. The goal of a DRP is to minimize downtime, restore critical data and systems, and get the business back up running as quickly as possible. We will be looking at:
- Business continity
- data protection
- communication
- restoration
- improvements
- potential threats
- prevention measures
- critical data
- recovery objectives
- data backups
- Cloud storage
  
* Respond The IT has extablished a plan to notify Europe customers within 72 hours if there is a security breach. Additionally, provacy policies, procedures, and preocesses have been developed and are enforced among IT department members/ other employees, to properly document and maintain data.
recover

3 RISK ASSESSMENT
-evaluate potential threats to assests including cyberattacks (malware/ransomware) insider threats, physical thefts ect.
-Aasses bulnerabilities within current systems using tools like bulnerability scanners. We will follow the Nationa Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) Cybersecurity Framwork that probides a structure approach for organizations.

4 REVIEW POLICIES AND PROCEDURES
-Examine existing cybersecurity policie incident reponse plans, employee training progralms, remote working protocols.
In Botium Toys, although a password policy exists, its requirements are nominal and not in line with current minimum password complexity requirements. We will have rules that will have employee followed. Example at least eight charecters, or a combination of letters and at least one number,and special characters.
There will be Security awareness training will be put in place to facilitate recovery of log in passwords, and importance to safeguar log in information.

5 ACCESS CONTROL EVALUATION
-Review user permissions across various platforms ensuring least privilege prociples are followed; check if multi-factor authentication is implemented where necessary.
-Botium Toys access controls pertaining to least privilege and separation of duties have not been implemented.
-information team will be build, inventory and manage assets,assess risk, manage risk, develop and incident Management and Disaster Recovery plan, Inventory and manage third parties , and apply security controls.

Administrative/Managerial controls
Technical controls
Physical/Operational controls
 
Administrative/Managerial controls address the human component of cybersecurity. These controls include policies and procedures that define how an organization manages data and clearly defines employee responsibilities, including their role in protecting the organization. While administrative controls are typically policy based, the enforcement of those policies may require the use of technical or physical controls. 

Technical controls consist of solutions such as firewalls, intrusion detection systems (IDS), intrusion prevention systems (IPS), antivirus (AV) products, encryption, etc. Technical controls can be used in a number of ways to meet organizational goals and objectives.

Physical/Operational controls include door locks, cabinet locks, surveillance cameras, badge readers, etc. They are used to limit physical access to physical assets by unauthorized personnel. 
Control types
Control types include, but are not limited to:	
Preventative
Corrective
Detective
Deterrent


6 NETWORK SECURITY ANALYSIS
-Analyze firewalls, intrusion detection/prevention systems, and network segmentation proctices.
-IT has ensured availability and integrated controls to ensure data integrity.
-IT department has firewall that blocks traffic based on  an approprieately defined set of security rules.
- Antivirus software is intalled and monitored regularly by the IY department.
- IT department has not installed an intrusion detection system (IDS)

7 DATA PROTECION MEASURES
-Evaluate encryption methods for both stored data ("at rest") as well as during transmission ("in transit"). Ensure proper backup procedures exit along with regular testing of recovery strategies.
IT department has no disaster recory plan currently in place, and the company does not have backups of critical data.
- a strategy that involves regularly copying and storing critical daya in separate location, allowing Botium Toys to restore information if it is lost or compromised due to a cyberattack, system failure,orother incident. The key aspects of a backup plan will be:
- backup schedule
- storage methods
- backup rotation
- recovery procedures
  Backup plan are important for data protection, business continuity, and compliance requirements.

8 iNCIDENT RESPONSE PLAN TESTING
- Assess whether there exists a documented plan detailing actions taken when breaches occur;conduct tabletop exercises simulating different scenarios.
  
9 COMPLIANCE CHECK
  - Ensure adherence not only towards general standards but also specific ones applicable based upon geographical location e.g COPPA (Children's Online Privacy Protection Act).This act will enforced:
  - Data security
  - Data rention
  - parental consent
  - Personal information
  - Privacy notics
  - EdTech
  - Safe Harbor Programs
  - COPPA applies to websites or oline services that are directed to chridren under 13, or that have actual knowledge of collecting personal information from children under 13.

10 REPORTING FINDINGS
- Compile findings into comprehensive report highlighting strengths/ weaknesses alongside actionable recommendations aimed at improbing overall security framework.
- Right now Botium Toys the IT department has esrablished a plan to notify European cusromers within 72 hours if there is a security breach.
- Additionally privacy policies , procedures, and processes have been developed and are enforced among IT department members/other employees to properly document and maintain data.
- By following thse steps diligeltly while engaging stakeholders throughout process ensures thorough understanding leading ultimately better safeguarding against future risk.
